First assignment of advanced and robot programming class concerns the development
of a robot simulator which simulates the behaviour of a Hoist.

Inside the .zip archive are contained five files, three shell scripts the
sources.zip archive and the text file you are reading. In the sources archive
you find 6 directories wich contain the .c file and also a .txt file with 
informations about each process.

First of all to unzip the sources archive and install the program using the command:

source ./install.sh <pathname>

It will create a folder called <pathname> inside which are located the folders that
were in sources.zip, there will also be a folder with the executables of each process.

After that run the program with the command:

./run.sh

During the execution hoist position and the given commands are written in the logfile
that you can find in the logfile directory

----------------------------------SIMULATOR BEHAVIOR-----------------------------------

The hoist simulator has 2 d.o.f. and two different consoles allows the user to activate
the hoist. 
The command console is where the user can give the command to move the hoist along the
two directions, while the inspection console is where the position is printed. In the
inspection console the user can also give two commands one to stop the movement and 
one to reset the position. Other two processes are thought to simulate the motors.
There is also a watchdog  wich checks the previous 4 processes periodically, and sends 
a reset in case all processes did nothing for 60 seconds.
Processes communicate using named pipes and signals, everything is managed by the master
process.
